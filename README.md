Weather App
This is a simple weather app that uses the WeatherAPI.com API to display the current weather for a given location. The app is built using the Flutter framework and the Riverpod state management library.
## Getting Started

Architecture

The app follows the Riverpod architecture, which is a modern and easy-to-use state management solution for Flutter. Riverpod is based on the concept of providers, which are objects that can provide values to other objects in a reactive way.
